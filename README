###usage

perl Ancestry_HMM_parallel_v3.pl read_list

###set parameters in configuration file:

hmm_configuration_file.cfg

###In the configuration file, give absolute paths from the directory where the jobs are submitted in the configuration file
##for example:

./example/genome1.fa

#instead of:

genome1.fa

###the full path is also needed in the reads list, and that list needs to be in the directory where the analysis is being run

###DEPENDENCIES:
###############

###depends on the following programs that most clusters will already have installed:
##bwa ~(v0.7.15)
##samtools ~(v1.3.1)
##bcftools ~(1.3.1)

###depends on the following packages/libraries that will probably not already be installed
##armadillo #wget http://sourceforge.net/projects/arma/files/armadillo-7.960.0.tar.xz
##gperftools #git clone https://github.com/gperftools/gperftools.git
##ngsutils #git clone git://github.com/ngsutils/ngsutils.git
##Ancestry_HMM # git clone https://github.com/russcd/Ancestry_HMM.git
###NOTE: Ancestry_HMM will not install properly without armadillo and gperftools

##to test whether the pipeline will have required dependencies before running, go to the folder where you will submit the job and type:

bwa
samtools
bcftools
bamutils

#if all of these print the usage, then you are good to go!

ancestry_hmm

#for this command, it will not print usage, but if it prints: 

reading command line
ERROR: must provide input file
-i [path/to/input_file]

#it is installed properly
